# Open Refine
OpenRefine is an open-source desktop application for data cleanup and transformation to other formats, an activity commonly known as data wrangling. It is similar to spreadsheet applications, and can handle spreadsheet file formats such as CSV, but it behaves more like a database.

----

## Setup Instructions
In preparation for this module, you will need to download and unzip the Open Refine package. The steps to do this are:

* Go to the [downloads page for Open Refine](https://openrefine.org/download.html)
* Click the Highlighted text that represents your operating system (If you are using windows and are unsure if you have java, choose the option that comes with Java)
* Save the file to your computer in a location that you have access to
* Unzip the file using your preferred zipping tool (right click on the folder and choose the program to unzip with like 7zip or WinZip)
(Optional) Make a shortcut on your desktop by opening the folder, right clicking openrefine.exe (blue gem symbol) and clicking "create shortcut" (you may need to move the new shortcut to your desktop manually depending on your operating system)

You will also need to download the dataset for the workshop by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/BrockDSL/Step-by-Step-guide-to-Open-Refine/blob/master/Open%20Refine%20Data%20Set.csv)

## What are Data Types?

Data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. Understanding data types ensures that data is collected in the preferred format and the value of each property is as expected.
